# Palantir Security Bulletins

## About This Repository

The goal of this project is to provide security bulletins related to security issues we have identified in our supported software products. Where possible, common vulnerabilities and disclosures (CVEs) are also issued.

These security bulletins include a summary of the issue, background context including scope and impact, remediation steps, and a timeline.

We endeavor to publicly disclose issues no more than 30 days after an issue has been identified, fixed, and communicated to our customers. We reserve the right to delay this disclosure deadline as needed for information security or other purposes.

## Contributing
