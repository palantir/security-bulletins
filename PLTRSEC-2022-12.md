## Summary

Palantir Gotham version prior to 3.22.11.2 included two unauthenticated endpoints that would have allowed an attacker to exhaust the memory of the Gotham dispatch server.

## Background

Palantir Gotham is a platform that enables the worldâ€™s most important organizations to surface insights from complex data and presents them in a single view that enables users to make faster, more confident decisions.
