# Security Bulletin

**Bulletin ID:** PLTRSEC-2023-03

**CVE:** CVE-2022-48307

**Affected Products / Versions:**

* Magritte-ftp versions before 9.466.0

**Publication Date:** Feb 14, 2023

## Summary

Several Palantir services, including magritte-ftp were not properly validating hostnames in TLS certificates. The affected services have been patched and automatically deployed to all Apollo-managed Foundry instances. It is highly recommended that customers upgrade all affected services to the latest version.

## Background

Palantir Foundry is a platform that enables auditable, arbitrary-scale transformations on data while preserving fine-grained access controls.

Palantir Gotham is a platform that enables the worldâ€™s most important organizations to surface insights from complex data and presents them in a single view that enables users to make faster, more confident decisions.

Magritte-ftp is an optional plugin for Palantir Foundry that ingests data from FTP servers.

## Details

On September 30th, 2022, it was discovered that the Gotham Chat IRC Helper was not verifying hostnames in TLS certificates due to a misuse of the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory API. A malicious attacker in a privileged network position could abuse this to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. A successful man-in-the-middle attack would allow them to intercept, read, or modify network communications to and from the affected service. Upon further investigation, several other services, including AtlasDB, magritte-ftp, and sls-logging were discovered to use a similar vulnerable pattern.

* In the case of a successful man in the middle attack on magritte-ftp, an attacker would be able to read and modify network traffic such as authentication tokens or raw data entering a Palantir Foundry stack.

## Remediation

On Palantir-managed environments, the following services have been upgraded to patched versions which properly validate hostnames in TLS certificates. Customers which manage their own environments without Apollo should reach out to their forward deployed engineer or other Palantir POC.

* Magritte-ftp, if it is in use, to version >=9.466.0 (Foundry only)
